# CS4348 Project1
Encryption/DecryptionProgram

The project will be implemented as three separate programs. There will be a logger –
responsible for logging all activity. There will be an encryption program – responsible for
encrypting and decrypting strings. There will be a driver program that will interact with
the user to use the encryption program. The entire system will be ran by running the driver
program, which will launch the other programs and communicate with them through pipes.
If you use C/C++ to code your project you must use the linux system calls fork,pipe, and
dup2. If use Java to code your project you must use the Process class. If you use Python
use the Subprocess module.
